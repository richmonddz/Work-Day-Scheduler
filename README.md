# Work-Day-Scheduler

This week we had to create a work day scheduler that would utalize APIs and moment js. It needed to indicate past, present and future hours with colors and also use local storage to save any tasks that are entered into the textarea.

# How To Use

The scheduler has the hours of a 9am-5pm shift/day. You can enter any tasks needed to be done and plan out your day. After an entry has been made into the text area you can click on the save icon to keep the note active even after the page is refreshed. As the hours pass by the color indicators will begin to change. Past hours will show in a gray color, current will be in red, and future will be in green.
